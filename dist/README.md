# Conduits!

RxJS Replay Subjects with additional functionality

## Dude just use signals???

- Angular's use of RxJS goes back further, and signals still aren't supported everywhere yet.
- Some applications are still better-suited for RxJS.

## Features

- ðŸ”„ **Late Subscriber Catch-Up**: Never miss a value again!
- ðŸ’ª **Flexible**: Easy to use even with minimal planning done in advance!
- ðŸŽ¯ **Type-Safe**: Full TypeScript support!
- ðŸ›  **Framework Compatible**: Use the subclasses like `NgConduit` for easy cleanup on component destruction!

## Installation

```bash
npm install rxjs-conduit
```

## Usage

### Basic Vanilla Usage
```ts
import { Conduit } from 'rxjs-conduit/vanilla';

const source = new Conduit<string>();

// Use .then for single-shot observations that auto-unsubscribe
source.then(value => console.log(`${value} world`));

source.next("hello"); // "hello world"
source.next("hi");

// Late subscriptions get updated with the last event
source.subscribe(value => console.log(`${value} npm!`)); // "hi npm!"

source.next("bye"); // "bye npm!"
source.complete();
```

### Angular Integration
```ts
import { Component, ViewChild, Input } from '@angular/core';
import { interval } from 'rxjs'

// NgConduit injects a DestroyRef, and knows when to clean itself up!
import { NgConduit } from 'rxjs-conduit/angular';

type Thing = {
    data$: Conduit<string>
}

@Component({
    selector: 'app-thing-view',
    templateUrl: './thing-view.component.html',
    styleUrls: ['./thing-view.component.scss']
})
export class ThingViewComponent {

    /*
        Ever tried to access something only for Angular to be like,
        > "that's not ready in this lifecycle hook yet!!!"
        Hook a setter to a conduit and never worry again.
    */
    @ViewChild(ChildComponent)
        protected set child(c: ChildComponent){ _child$.next(c); }
        protected get child(){ return _child$.value as ChildComponent }
    private _child$ = new NgConduit<ChildComponent>();

    /*
        In one case, I needed nested reactivity on an Angular input.
        For this, .inner() is a fantastic tool.
    */
    @Input()
        public set thing(t: Thing){ this._thing$.next(t) }
        public get thing(){ return this._thing$.value as Thing }
    private _thing$ = new NgConduit<Thing>();

    // use this as normal, it will update both sources
    protected thingData$ = _thing$.inner( (thing) => thing.data$ );

    constructor(){
        // This will run as soon as Angular decides to set up the child
        _child$.then( child => child.doSomething() );
    }
}

```

## API: `Conduit`
###### (Things that `Subject` can already do are omitted.)

### `new Conduit(first?: T)`
Creates a new conduit, optionally with an initial value.

### `Conduit.derived(sources, formula): ReadonlyConduit`
Creates a conduit whose value is derived using a formula and a set of source conduits.  
Completes when all sources complete and errors if *any* source errors.

### `subscribe(observer): Subscription`
Adds a subscription to this conduit, which will receive reactive updates.

### `inner(getter): Conduit`
Creates a special "proxy" conduit based on the getter and value(s) of this conduit.

### `then(callback): Subscription`
Similar to `subscribe`, but it only runs once then cleans up the subscription.

### `unsubscribe(): void`
Removes all subscribers to this conduit without notifying them.

### `splice(source, config?): Conduit`
Adds a source to this conduit, which will feed it values reactively until it completes. &nbsp;Returns self.  

### `unsplice(name?): boolean`
Disconnects a previous spliced source from this conduit, if it was named.  
Pass no name to unsplice everything.

### `sealed: boolean`
True after it completes or errors.

### `value: T`
Returns the most recent value, or `Conduit.EMPTY` if there isn't one yet.

### `valueOrDefault(fallback): T`
Returns the conduit's value, or returns the fallback if it's empty.

### `valueOrThrow(reason): T`
Returns the conduit's value, or throws the reason if it's empty.

### `flush(): void`
Sets the conduit back to `Conduit.EMPTY` without notifying subscribers.

## Bonus API: `Gate`

### `new Gate()`
Creates a semaphore.

### `run(section): T`
Runs the section if the gate isn't currently running anything else.  
Returns the result, or `Gate.BLOCKED` if it didn't run.

### `open: boolean`
Is the gate ready to run something?

### `Gate.bind(first, second, conversions...): Unsubscribable`
Creates a two-way binding between a pair of conduits.
