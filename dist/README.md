# Conduits!

A special extension of RxJS Subjects, which remember the last value emitted to "catch up" any late subscribers.

## Dude just use signals???

- Angular's use of RxJS goes back further, so I'd rather use that. &nbsp;Computed signals are also too "magical" for me.
- I find this way of doing things more intuitive. &nbsp;If you prefer something else, do that and save yourself the dependency!

## Features

- üîÑ **Late Subscriber Catch-Up**: Never miss a value again!
- ‚úÖ **Easy to Learn**: Probably easier to learn than RxJS, anyway.
- üéØ **Type-Safe**: Full TypeScript support!
- üõ† **Framework Compatible**: Use the subclasses like `NgConduit` for easy cleanup on component destruction!

## Installation

```bash
npm install rxjs-conduit
```

## Usage

### Basic Vanilla Usage
```ts
import { Conduit } from 'rxjs-conduit/vanilla';

const source = new Conduit<number>(42);

// Late subscribers will instantly receive a "catch-up" if the conduit has a value
source.subscribe(value => console.log(value + "a")); // -> 42a

// Conduits otherwise behave the same as a normal RxJS Subject
source.next(100); // -> 100a

// "catch-up" is always to the most recent value
source.subscribe(value => console.log(value + "b")); // -> 100b
```

### Angular Integration
```ts
import { NgConduit } from 'rxjs-conduit/angular';
import type { ReadonlyConduit } from 'rxjs-conduit/vanilla';
import { Component, ViewChild } from '@angular/core';
import { interval } from 'rxjs'

@Component({
    selector: 'app-example',
    templateUrl: './example.component.html',
    styleUrls: ['./example.component.scss']
})
export class ExampleComponent {
    
    // create stress-free observavles that automatically complete when the component is destroyed!
    protected ticker$ = new NgConduit<number>();

    // learning the angular lifecycle is hard... but you don't have to with conduits!
    public child$: ReadonlyConduit<ChildComponent> = new NgConduit<ChildComponent>();
    
    @ViewChild
    protected set child(value: ChildComponent){ child$.next(value) }

    constructor(){
        // internal spliced subscriptions are cleaned up for you too!
        ticker$.splice( interval(1000) );
    }
}
```

### Value Peeking
```typescript
const conduit = new Conduit<string>('initial');

// Access the current value
console.log(conduit.value); // 'initial'

// And if there isn't a value yet...
const empty = new Conduit<string>();
console.log(empty.value); // Conduit.EMPTY
```

## API

### `new Conduit(first?: T)`
Creates a new conduit, optionally with an initial value.

### `Conduit.derived(sources, formula): ReadonlyConduit<T>`
Creates a conduit whose value is derived using a formula and a set of source conduits.

### `splice(source, hard?): Conduit`
Streams events from another subscribable into this conduit. &nbsp;Returns self.  
üí° Use hard splices to pass through errors and completions from the source!

### `hasValue: boolean`
True if the conduit is pressurized with a value.

### `value: T`
Returns the most recent value. &nbsp;Throws an exception if there is no pressure.

### `then(callback): Subscription`
Similar to `subscribe`, but it only runs once then cleans up the subscription.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- Don't connect conduits in loops!
- NgConduits garbage collect themselves as needed.
