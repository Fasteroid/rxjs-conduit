# Conduits!

A special extension of RxJS Subjects, which remember the last value emitted to "catch up" any late subscribers.

## Dude just use signals???

- Angular's use of RxJS goes back further, so I'd rather use that. &nbsp;Computed signals are also too "magical" for me.
- I find this way of doing things more intuitive. &nbsp;If you prefer something else, do that and save yourself the dependency!

## Features

- üîÑ **Late Subscriber Catch-Up**: Never miss a value again!
- ‚úÖ **Easy to Learn**: Probably easier to learn than RxJS, anyway.
- üéØ **Type-Safe**: Full TypeScript support!
- üõ† **Framework Compatible**: Use the subclasses like `NgConduit` for easy cleanup on component destruction!

## Installation

```bash
npm install rxjs-conduit
```

## Usage

### Basic Vanilla Usage
```ts
import { Conduit } from 'rxjs-conduit/vanilla';

const source = new Conduit<string>();

// Use .then for single-shot observations that auto-unsubscribe
source.then(value => console.log(`${value} world`));

source.next("hello"); // "hello world"
source.next("hi");

// Late subscriptions get updated with the last event
source.subscribe(value => console.log(`${value} npm!`)); // "hi npm!"

source.next("bye"); // "bye npm!"
source.complete();
```

### Angular Integration
```ts
import { NgConduit } from 'rxjs-conduit/angular';
import type { ReadonlyConduit } from 'rxjs-conduit/vanilla';
import { Component, ViewChild } from '@angular/core';
import { interval } from 'rxjs'

@Component({
    selector: 'app-example',
    templateUrl: './example.component.html',
    styleUrls: ['./example.component.scss']
})
export class ExampleComponent {

    /*
        NgConduit injects DestroyRef so it can unsubscribe
        itself when the component is destroyed.
    */
    private _child$ = new NgConduit<ChildComponent>();    
    
    /*
        Remembering when in the Angular component lifecycle decorated
        values like this initialize is error-prone for beginners.

        With a conduit and a setter, this becomes asynchronous code
        until it initializes properly.
    */
    @ViewChild(ChildComponent)
        protected set child(value: ChildComponent){ 
            _child$.next(value);
        }
        protected get child(){ 
            return _child$.value as ChildComponent // slightly unsafe!
        }

    constructor(){
        _child$.then( child => child.doSomething() );
    }

}
```

## API

### `new Conduit(first?: T)`
Creates a new conduit, optionally with an initial value.

### `Conduit.derived(sources, formula): ReadonlyConduit<T>`
Creates a conduit whose value is derived using a formula and a set of source conduits.  
Completes when all sources complete and errors if *any* source errors.

### `splice(source, hard?): Conduit`
Streams events from another subscribable into this conduit. &nbsp;Returns self.  
üí° Use hard splices to pass through errors and completions from the source!

### `sealed: boolean`
True after it completes or errors.

### `value: T`
Returns the most recent value, or `Conduit.EMPTY` if there isn't one yet.

### `then(callback): Subscription`
Similar to `subscribe`, but it only runs once then cleans up the subscription.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- Don't connect conduits in loops under any circumstances!
- Don't use this for anything mission-critical; I am a complete noob and
  am actively learning new things every day!
